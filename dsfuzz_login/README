This script would try and explot a SQLi vulnerability in the login page on one of tha application which i am testing. 
The login page had 6 302 redirections and then allows login and thus using my other scripts or tools was pretty much time consuming. 

This is one of my first python scripts so pardon me if i goof up some where. Just added multithreading to increase concurrent scans.
